# Tilt Device to Move Cursor

Final project for 05-499 Interaction Techniques

## Interaction Technique

Definition paraphrased from Wikipedia: An interaction technique is a combination of hardware and software elements that provides a way for computer users to accomplish a single task.

This project's goal is to introduce a new interaction technique for smartphone, tablet, and other mobile device text entry. One of the greatest challenges when entering text on mobile devices is manual movement of the cursor. Few mobile keyboards offer dedicated arrow keys, so a finger must be used to make cursor position changes; this can be slow. We propose that the cursor could be moved to new positions by tilting the device at an angle. The cursor's movement correlates to the angle.

## Technology

The programming language used to implement this prototype is RubyMotion: a propriety toolchain that combines the Ruby language with Objective-C classes and methods allowing for the easy development of iOS applications.

### Basic Info

* RubyMotion is a combination of Ruby and Obj-C. It is compiled in the form of an iOS app. This technology is proprietary and costs money to own.
* Rails developers will feel relatively at home with RubyMotion. All commands are run through the terminal. `rake` and `motion` are the commands used to complete most tasks.
* RubyMotion apps are fully App Store complient (assuming the developer has followed the proper guidelines).
